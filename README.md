# Swift TO Sample App
------
This app was written as a compliment and an example for a talk given at Swift TO Conference 2019 titled "How to write testable code"

------
The none testable version is in the `low_testabilitiness` branch, while the refactored (slightly more test-friendly) version is in `master`.
